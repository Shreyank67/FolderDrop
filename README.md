## FolderDrop

A lightweight native macOS menu bar application that lets you browse and access files without opening Finder.

Built as a learning project in SwiftUI while recreating and extending the idea behind FolderPeek.
P.S. Honestly I didnt want to pay for FolderPeek and thaught it'll be fun to build my own!

# Current Progress

## ✅ Phase 1 — Foundation

- [x] Native SwiftUI Menu Bar application
- [x] GitHub repository
- [x] Project architecture

---

## ✅ Feature 1 — Menu Bar App

### Goal

Convert a standard macOS window application into a native MenuBarExtra utility.

### Concepts Learned

- SwiftUI App lifecycle
- MenuBarExtra
- Scenes

### Concepts Learned

- @State
- URL
- NSOpenPanel
- Optional Binding
- AppKit + SwiftUI

### Result

- Select Folder button

- Folder path displayed

---

## ✅ Feature 3 — Folder Browser

### Goal

Display the contents of the selected folder.

### Concepts Learned

- FileManager
- Directory enumeration
- List
- ForEach
- Identifiable
- Security Scoped Resources
- File sorting

### Result

- Folder contents displayed
- Folders first
- Files second
- Alphabetical sorting
